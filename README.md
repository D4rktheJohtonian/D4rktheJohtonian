↳- **Interactions** -༉‧₊˚✧

*C+H is welcome! (Especially if you're Blue/Red/Ethan :3). I block freely.*

*If I interact with you, one of them is either because...* 🎤

- I am interested in you.
- I have no one to talk to.
- I like your personality/avatar.

*If I don't respond or interact back to you, one of them is either because...* 💭
- I'm afk.
- I'm too shy to respond at the moment.
- I'm opening other app.
- I'm drawing/making characters.
- I accidentally fall asleep (15% chances).

  *If my responses is too slow, then it's either I'm trying to think of a response or I'm talking to someone else in rl.*

*DNI and BYI check my strawpage.*

**NOTE :**

I know all Pokémon medias *except* for the anime. I *hate* Goh, Chloe and Journey Ash. They sucks.

For PokéSpe/manga, I *only know* the characters and not the storyline.

Also please check my strawpage/atabook and maybe gimme some messages/drawing!
